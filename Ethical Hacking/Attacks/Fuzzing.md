# Fuzzing

Fuzzing, also known as fuzz testing or simply "fuzzing," is an automated testing technique that involves providing unexpected, random, or malformed data as input to a software application to uncover vulnerabilities. The goal is to find security flaws, such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, or other unexpected behaviors, by bombarding the target with a large amount of invalid or unexpected data.

Fuzzing tools generate and send a variety of inputs to the target software, exploring different combinations and permutations to see if any input triggers an unexpected response or behavior. If the software fails to handle the input correctly, it could indicate a potential security vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker.
