# Pass-the-Hash Attack

A Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack is a technique where an attacker captures a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and then passes it through for authentication and lateral access to other networked systems. With this technique, the threat actor doesnâ€™t need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plain text password.
