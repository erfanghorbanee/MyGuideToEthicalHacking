# Spectre/Meltdown attack

**Spectre** and **Meltdown** are two major security vulnerabilities discovered in 2018 that affect modern microprocessors, particularly those using speculative execution, a feature designed to improve performance.

## Spectre

- **What it is**: Spectre is a vulnerability that exploits the speculative execution process to trick a program into accessing arbitrary locations in memory. It allows attackers to read potentially sensitive data from other processes running on the same system.
- **How it works**: Spectre attacks involve manipulating the branch prediction feature of a CPU to execute code that shouldn't be executed, allowing an attacker to read memory that would otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Impact**: Spectre is more difficult to exploit than Meltdown but affects a wider range of processors, including those from Intel, AMD, and ARM.

## Meltdown

- **What it is**: Meltdown is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass the CPU's memory protection mechanisms, enabling them to read the entire physical memory of a machine, including sensitive data like passwords and encryption keys.
- **How it works**: Meltdown exploits a flaw in the way Intel processors handle out-of-order execution, allowing an attacker to read memory that should be restricted to the operating system.
- **Impact**: Meltdown is easier to exploit but primarily affects Intel processors.

### Consequences of Spectre and Meltdown

- **Data Leakage**: Both vulnerabilities could allow attackers to access sensitive information, such as passwords, encryption keys, and other private data.
- **Performance Impact**: Patches and mitigations have been released to address these vulnerabilities, but some of these fixes can lead to performance degradation in affected systems.
- **Widespread Impact**: Given that the vulnerabilities affect a wide range of processors, almost all modern devices, including computers, smartphones, and cloud servers, were potentially vulnerable.

### Mitigation

- **Patches**: Operating system and firmware updates have been released by various vendors to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- **Hardware Fixes**: Some newer processors have been designed with mitigations built-in to prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited.
