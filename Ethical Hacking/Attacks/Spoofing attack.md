# Spoofing attack

A spoofing attack is a type of cyberattack where a malicious actor disguises themselves as a trusted entity by falsifying data, such as IP addresses, email addresses, or websites. The goal is to deceive the target into believing they are interacting with a legitimate source, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, spread malware, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
