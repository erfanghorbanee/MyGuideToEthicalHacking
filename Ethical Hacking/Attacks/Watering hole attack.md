# Watering hole attack

A watering hole attack is a targeted attack designed to aim at a specific group of people by compromising the website they are usually visiting and then redirecting them to the malicious website of an attacker's choice. The attacker would look for a known vulnerability for the website and try to exploit it.

The attacker would encourage the victims to visit the website by sending "harmless" emails pointing out the malicious URL to make the attack work more efficiently. After visiting the website, the victim would unintentionally download malware or a malicious application to their computer. 

This type of attack is called a drive-by download. An example can be a malicious pop-up asking to download a fake Browser extension.
