# Web Timing Attacks

Web timing attacks exploit timing discrepancies in web applications to compromise their functionality, often leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation. By sending multiple simultaneous or synchronized requests, attackers aim to interfere with processes that depend on sequence or timing, creating race conditions or exposing vulnerabilities.

## Race Condition Attacks

Race condition attacks occur when a web application performs multiple operations in sequence without sufficient safeguards, allowing an attacker to manipulate or disrupt the sequence. These attacks take advantage of parallel execution and timing gaps in web applications.

### Key Objective

Ensure all requests reach the web server within as small of a timeframe as possible. This minimizes the chance for the system to handle each request properly in isolation, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Methods for Race Condition Exploitation

1. **Concurrent Requests (Threads)**
   - Multiple threads or processes are launched simultaneously, each sending a separate request to the target web application.
   - These threads compete for server resources, increasing the likelihood of interrupting the normal sequence of operations.
   - Example: Submitting two payment requests in parallel to exploit incorrect balance verification logic.

2. **Last-Byte Sync**
   - In this method, attackers craft requests to ensure the server receives the final byte of multiple requests nearly simultaneously.
   - This precise synchronization increases the likelihood of disrupting operations that depend on the order or timing of requests.
   - Example: Attempting to finalize multiple transactions at once, bypassing checks such as inventory availability or user balance.

## Practical Examples of Web Timing Attacks

1. **Duplicate Payment Exploit**:
   - Sending two payment requests simultaneously may result in both being processed, even if the system is designed to handle only one transaction per user.

2. **Inventory Manipulation**:
   - Concurrently requesting the purchase of an item with limited stock may bypass checks, allowing an attacker to obtain more items than allowed.

3. **Authentication Timing**:
   - By measuring the response time of authentication mechanisms, attackers can infer valid credentials or other sensitive information.

## Mitigation Strategies

To defend against web timing attacks, implement the following measures:

1. **Atomic Operations**:
   - Use locks or transactions to ensure operations are performed as an indivisible unit, preventing interference from concurrent requests.

2. **Request Throttling**:
   - Limit the number of requests a user can send within a given time period.

3. **Randomized Delays**:
   - Introduce randomized delays in sensitive operations to reduce the reliability of timing measurements.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Test for race conditions and timing vulnerabilities during the development phase using tools and simulated attack scenarios.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for unusual patterns of simultaneous requests and log events to identify potential timing attacks.
