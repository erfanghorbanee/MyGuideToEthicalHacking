# XXE

An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data. It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system. They can also cause Denial of Service (DoS) attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) inducing the web application to make requests to other applications. XXE may even enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.

There are two types of XXE attacks: in-band and out-of-band (OOB-XXE).

1. An in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.
2. out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

# DTD

DTD stands for Document Type Definition. A DTD defines the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document.

Say we have a file named note.dtd with the following content:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE note [ <!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]>
```

Now we can use this DTD to validate the information of some XML document and make sure that the XML file conforms to the rules of that DTD.

Ex: Below is given an XML document that uses note.dtd

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "note.dtd">
<note>
    <to>falcon</to>
    <from>feast</from>
    <heading>hacking</heading>
    <body>XXE attack</body>
</note>
```

So now let's understand how that DTD validates the XML. Here's what all those terms used in note.dtd mean

- !DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named note
- !ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
- !ELEMENT to - Defines the to element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT from - Defines the from element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT heading  - Defines the heading element to be of type "#PCDATA"
- !ELEMENT body - Defines the body element to be of type "#PCDATA"

**NOTE: #PCDATA means parseable character data.**

## Payloads

We can use XXE to read some file from the system by defining an ENTITY and having it use the SYSTEM keyword:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]>
<root>&read;</root>
```

Here again, we are defining an ENTITY with the name read but the difference is that we are setting it value to `SYSTEM` and path of the file.

If we use this payload then a website vulnerable to XXE(normally) would display the content of the file /etc/passwd.
