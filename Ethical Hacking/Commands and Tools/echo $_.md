# echo $?

The command `echo $?` in a Unix-like operating system, such as Linux or macOS, is used to display the exit status of the last command executed in the shell.

`$?` is a special variable in the shell that holds the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline. An exit status of 0 typically means that the command was successful, while a non-zero exit status indicates an error or an abnormal completion.

So, when you run `echo $?`, it prints the exit status of the previous command. This can be useful for debugging scripts or checking if a command succeeded or failed in automated scripts or during manual troubleshooting.
