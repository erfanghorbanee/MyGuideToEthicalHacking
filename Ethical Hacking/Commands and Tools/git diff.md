# git diff

`git diff` is a command that outputs the difference between two
files. You need to install the Git program to use it. You can use git diff to compare scan results at different times, which quickly lets you see if the target has changed since you last scanned it:
`git diff SCAN_1 SCAN_2`

This will help to identify any new domains, subdomains, endpoints,
and other new assets of a target.
