# Atomic Red Team

**Atomic Red Team** is an open-source project created by [Red Canary](https://redcanary.com/) that provides a library of small, highly portable tests designed to simulate the techniques adversaries use to compromise systems. These tests are mapped to the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of security controls, improve detection capabilities, and validate defense mechanisms. 

The project is designed for simplicity, allowing organizations to run individual tests without extensive setup, making it accessible for both red teams and blue teams.
