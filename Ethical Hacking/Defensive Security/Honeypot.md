# Honeypot

A honeypot is a cyber security mechanism – a masterful deception. It presents itself as an alluring target to the adversaries, drawing them away from the true prizes. Honeypots come in various forms: software applications, servers, or entire networks. They are designed to mimic legitimate targets, yet they are under the watchful control of the defender.

Honeypots can be classified into two main types:

- Low–interaction honeypots: These honeypots artfully mimic simple systems like web servers or databases. They gather intelligence on attacker behaviour and detect new attack techniques.
- High–interaction honeypots: These honeypots take deception to new heights, emulating complex systems like operating systems and networks. They collect meticulous details on attacker behaviour and study their techniques to exploit vulnerabilities.
