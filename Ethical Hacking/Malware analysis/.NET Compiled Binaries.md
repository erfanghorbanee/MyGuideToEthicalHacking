# .NET Compiled Binaries

.NET binaries are compiled files containing code written in languages compatible with the .NET framework, such as C#, VB.NET, F#, or managed C++. These binaries are executable files (with the .exe extension) or dynamic link libraries (DLLs with the .dll extension). They can also be assemblies that contain multiple types and resources.

Compared to other programming languages like C or C++, languages that use .NET, such as C#, don't directly translate the code into machine code after compilation. Instead, they use an intermediate language (IL), like a pseudocode, and translate it into native machine code during runtime via a Common Language Runtime (CLR) environment.

In simple terms, it's only possible to analyse a C or C++ compiled binary by reading its assembly instructions (low-level). Meanwhile, a C# binary can be decompiled and its source code retrieved since the intermediate language contains metadata that can be reconverted to its source code form.
