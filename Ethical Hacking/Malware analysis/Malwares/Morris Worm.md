# Morris Worm

The Morris Worm, also known as the Great Worm, was one of the earliest computer worms that spread through the internet. It was created by Robert Tappan Morris and was released on November 2, 1988. The worm was intended to gauge the size of the internet, but due to a programming error, it spread much more aggressively than Morris had anticipated, causing widespread disruption.

The Morris Worm exploited vulnerabilities in various Unix-based systems, primarily through vulnerabilities in the Sendmail, Finger, and weak password practices. Since you specifically mentioned "Morris attack on finger," I assume you are referring to the exploitation of the Finger protocol.

The Finger protocol is a simple network protocol that provides information about users on a remote server or network. Morris exploited vulnerabilities in the Finger daemon (a program that responds to Finger protocol requests) to gain unauthorized access and propagate the worm.

Here's a brief overview of how the Morris Worm attacked the Finger protocol:

1. **Vulnerability Exploitation:** The Morris Worm targeted vulnerabilities in the Finger daemon on Unix systems. It exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability to execute malicious code on the targeted systems.

2. **Propagation:** Once a system was compromised, the worm attempted to spread to other systems by exploiting various vulnerabilities, including those in the Sendmail email system and weak password practices.

3. **Impact:** The rapid and uncontrolled spreading of the Morris Worm led to a significant slowdown of many affected systems and caused disruption on the early internet. The worm's unintended consequences highlighted the need for improved security practices and laid the groundwork for advancements in computer security.

The Morris Worm incident had a profound impact on the field of computer security, leading to increased awareness of the importance of securing computer systems and networks. It also played a role in shaping the development of cybersecurity practices and policies.
