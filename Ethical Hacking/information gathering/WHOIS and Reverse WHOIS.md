# WHOIS and Reverse WHOIS

When companies or individuals register a domain name, they need to supply identifying information, such as their mailing address, phone number, and email address, to a domain registrar. Anyone can then query this information by using the whois command, which searches for the registrant and owner information of each known domain. You might be able to find the associated contact information, such as an email, name, address, or phone number:
`$ whois facebook.com`

This information is not always available, as some organizations and
individuals use a service called domain privacy, in which a third-party service provider replaces the userâ€™s information with that of a forwarding service.

You could then conduct a **reverse WHOIS** search, searching a database by using an organization name, a phone number, or an email address to find domains registered with it. This way, you can find all the domains that belong to the same owner. Reverse WHOIS is extremely useful for finding obscure or internal domains not otherwise disclosed to the public. Use a public reverse WHOIS tool like [ViewDNS.info](https://viewdns.info/reversewhois/) to conduct this search.

WHOIS and reverse WHOIS will give you a good set of top-level domains to work with.
