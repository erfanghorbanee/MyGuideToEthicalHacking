# BCE

BCE (Business Email Compromise) is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker targets an organization by compromising business email accounts, often through phishing or social engineering tactics. The attacker typically impersonates a trusted individual, such as a company executive or a business partner, to deceive employees into transferring money, revealing sensitive information, or performing other actions that benefit the attacker.
