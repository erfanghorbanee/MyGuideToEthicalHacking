# CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), this term is given to a publicly disclosed vulnerability

CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER

**Note:** CVEs numbers are assigned when the vulnerability are discovered, not when they are publicised. Bear in mind that if a vulnerability is discovered at the end of a year, or if the process of confirming and rectifying the vulnerability takes a long time, then the release date might be the year after the year in the CVE date.
