# Cyber Kill Chain

The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework developed by Lockheed Martin to identify and prevent cyber attacks. It outlines the stages of a cyber attack and helps organizations understand how to defend against them. Here are the seven stages:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Attackers gather information about the target, such as identifying network vulnerabilities and user behavior.

2. **Weaponization**: Attackers create malicious software (malware) tailored to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.

3. **Delivery**: The malware is transmitted to the target system, often through phishing emails, malicious websites, or infected USB drives.

4. **Exploitation**: The malware is executed on the target system by exploiting a vulnerability.

5. **Installation**: The malware installs a backdoor or other persistent method to maintain access to the target system.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**: The attacker establishes a channel of communication with the compromised system to control it remotely.

7. **Actions on Objectives**: The attacker achieves their goals, which could include data theft, system disruption, or espionage.
