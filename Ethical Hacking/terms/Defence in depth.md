# Defence in depth

Defence in depth is a cybersecurity strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls to protect data and resources. If one layer fails, others still provide protection.

This approach includes physical, technical, and administrative measures, such as firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, access controls, and employee training.
