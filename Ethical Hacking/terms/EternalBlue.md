EternalBlue is an NSA-developed exploit targeting a flaw (CVE-2017-0144) in Windows SMBv1, leaked in 2017.

Major attacks like WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya used it to spread quickly, causing extensive global damage. Even though Microsoft patched it (MS17-010), unpatched systems were heavily exploited.

## Key points

- **Exploits SMBv1**: Enables remote code execution.
- **Major Impact**: WannaCry & NotPetya
- **Lesson**: Always apply security patches and keep systems updated to avoid vulnerabilities like this one from being exploited.
