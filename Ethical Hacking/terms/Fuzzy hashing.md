# Fuzzy hashing

Fuzzy hashing is a type of compression function for calculating the similarity between digital files. It attempts to automate the process of grouping similar malware. Fuzzy hash functions hold a certain tolerance for changes, and can tell how different two files are by comparing the similarity of their outputs.
