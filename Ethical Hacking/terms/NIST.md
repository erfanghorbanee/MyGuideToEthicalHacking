The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines and best practices developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. It provides a structured approach to identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber threats. The framework is organized into five core functions:

1. **Identify**: Understanding and managing cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
2. **Protect**: Implementing safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical infrastructure services.
3. **Detect**: Developing and implementing activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
4. **Respond**: Taking action regarding a detected cybersecurity event to mitigate its impact.
5. **Recover**: Planning and executing strategies to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event.

The CSF is flexible and can be tailored to various types and sizes of organizations, making it a widely adopted tool for improving cybersecurity practices.

**Note:** For its implementation, NIST relies on COBIT, ISA (or IEC 62443), ISO 27000, and NIST SP 800-53.
