# Pivoting

"Pivoting" is the technique an adversary uses to reach other systems within a network that are not otherwise accessible (for example, they are not exposed to the internet). There are often many systems in a network that are not directly reachable and often contain valuable data or have weaker security.

For example, an adversary can gain access to a web server that is publically accessible to attack other systems that are within the same network (but are not accessible via the internet).
