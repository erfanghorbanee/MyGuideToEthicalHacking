# Rootkits

A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to gain unauthorized root or administrative access to a computer system while concealing its presence and activities. Technically, it operates by modifying the system's kernel, altering core operating system functions, or installing itself at a lower system level, such as in firmware or the bootloader. This allows the rootkit to intercept and manipulate system calls, hide files or processes, and bypass standard security measures, making it difficult to detect and remove.

Rootkits can be used for various malicious purposes, including espionage, data theft, or creating a backdoor for persistent access to the compromised system.
