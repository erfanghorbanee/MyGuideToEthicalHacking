# SABSA

The SABSA (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) framework is a comprehensive approach to developing a security architecture that <ins>aligns with business needs</ins>. It was developed by John Sherwood in the 1990s. SABSA is a layered model that helps organizations create security strategies that are driven by business requirements rather than just technical considerations.

## Key Features of SABSA

1. **Business-Driven**: SABSA starts by identifying business requirements and ensuring that the security architecture supports these goals. It emphasizes that security should be an enabler of business objectives, not just a set of technical controls.

2. **Layered Architecture**: SABSA uses a layered approach, consisting of six layers that correspond to different aspects of security architecture:

    - **Contextual**: Understanding the business context.
    - **Conceptual**: Defining the security concepts required by the business.
    - **Logical**: Developing logical models and policies.
    - **Physical**: Designing the physical implementation of security controls.
    - **Component**: Detailed specification of individual components.
    - **Operational**: Day-to-day management and operation of security systems.
3. **Lifecycle Approach**: SABSA is not a one-time process; it integrates security throughout the lifecycle of systems and services, from conception through to decommissioning.

4. **Risk Management**: The framework emphasizes risk management by identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to align with the businessâ€™s risk appetite.

5. **Customization**: SABSA is adaptable to different types of organizations and industries. It can be tailored to meet the specific needs and maturity levels of different businesses.

In essence, SABSA ensures that security architecture is closely aligned with the overall business strategy, providing a structured way to design, implement, and manage security in a holistic manner.
