# SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

An SBOM is a detailed list of components in a piece of software. It includes information about the software libraries, dependencies, and their versions used to build the software. SBOMs are essential for understanding the software's supply chain, managing vulnerabilities, and ensuring compliance with licensing requirements. They help organizations track and address potential security issues that may arise from using third-party software components.
