# The Same Origin Policy (SOP)

The Same Origin Policy (SOP) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page. This policy is designed to protect users from certain types of security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The basic idea behind the Same Origin Policy is that web pages from one origin (a combination of protocol, domain, and port) should not be able to access or interact with resources from a different origin. This policy helps ensure that malicious scripts or content from one website cannot tamper with or access sensitive data on another website without explicit permission.

For example, if you have a web page loaded from "https://example.com," that page should only be able to make requests to resources (like API endpoints) on "https://example.com" and not on "https://malicious-site.com." Browsers enforce this policy by restricting certain types of cross-origin requests, such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API requests, from being made unless the target resource explicitly allows it through mechanisms like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers.

The Same Origin Policy is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of web applications, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data and protecting users from various web-based attacks. However, developers can use techniques like JSONP (JSON with Padding), Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and server-side proxies to work within the constraints of the Same Origin Policy when they need to make cross-origin requests in a controlled and secure manner.
