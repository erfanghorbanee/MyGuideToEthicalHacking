# Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity refers to the practice of securing systems by making the system or its underlying implementation hidden. The idea is that if the details are not publicly known, then it will be more difficult for potential attackers to identify and exploit vulnerabilities. However, this concept is highly criticized and generally not recommended as a primary security strategy.
