# TPRM (Third-Party Risk Management)

TPRM refers to the process of identifying, assessing, and managing the risks associated with third-party vendors or service providers. Organizations use TPRM to ensure that their partners and suppliers do not introduce unacceptable levels of risk into their operations. This includes evaluating the third party's security practices, compliance with regulations, financial stability, and overall impact on the organization's business continuity.
