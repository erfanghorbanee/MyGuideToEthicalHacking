# The Orange Book

The "Orange Book," officially known as the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), is a U.S. Department of Defense publication that establishes security standards for evaluating and classifying computer systems. Released in 1983, the Orange Book focuses on key topics such as access control, authentication, security policy enforcement, and system auditing.

It classifies computer security into levels ranging from D (the lowest level of protection) to A (the highest level of verified protection). Levels B and C represent intermediate levels of security, where B emphasizes mandatory access controls and C focuses on discretionary access controls.

One of the key models underpinning these classifications is the **Bell-LaPadula** model, which enforces data confidentiality by controlling access based on security labels.
