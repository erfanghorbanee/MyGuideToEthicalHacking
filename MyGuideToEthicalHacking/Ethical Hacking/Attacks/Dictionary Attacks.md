# Dictionary Attacks

A dictionary attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker systematically tries a large number of words or phrases from a precompiled list (often referred to as a "dictionary") in an attempt to gain unauthorized access to a user's account or system. This method is commonly used to crack passwords.

Here's how a dictionary attack typically works:

- Password Dictionary: The attacker uses a pre-existing list of words, phrases, or commonly used passwords as the dictionary. This list may include common words, combinations of words, names, and variations of known passwords.

- Automated Testing: The attacker uses an automated program or script to systematically test each entry in the dictionary as a possible password against a targeted system or user account.

- Password Cracking: The attacker continues testing passwords until they find the correct one that grants access to the targeted account or system. If the targeted user's password is weak or easily guessable, the attack is more likely to be successful.
