# dnSpy

dnSpy is an open-source .NET assembly (C#) debugger and editor. It is typically used for reverse engineering .NET applications and analysing their code and is primarily designed for examining and modifying .NET assemblies in a user-friendly, interactive way. It's also capable of modifying the retrieved source code (editing), setting breakpoints, or running through the code one step at a time (debugging).
